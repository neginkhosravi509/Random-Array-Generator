Random Array Generator

A C# program that fills an array with random values using the Next method from the Random class.

How it works

User defines the size of the array.

The program uses Random.Next() to assign random values to each element of the array.

The resulting array is printed to the console.


Example

Input: Array size 5
Output: 12 7 34 5 19
